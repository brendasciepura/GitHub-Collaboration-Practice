2. Clone the repository 
(base) brenda@Brendas-MacBook-Air-2 Project 1 % cd ~
(base) brenda@Brendas-MacBook-Air-2 ~ % cd github
(base) brenda@Brendas-MacBook-Air-2 github % git clone https://github.com/brendasciepura/GitHub-Collaboration-Practice.git

3. Create markdown or text file with the text "Group project" on the first line.

(base) brenda@Brendas-MacBook-Air-2 github % cd GitHub-Collaboration-Practice
(base) brenda@Brendas-MacBook-Air-2 GitHub-Collaboration-Practice % touch "File 1.txt"
(base) brenda@Brendas-MacBook-Air-2 GitHub-Collaboration-Practice % nano "File 1.txt"
(base) brenda@Brendas-MacBook-Air-2 GitHub-Collaboration-Practice % cat "File 1.txt"
Group Project

4b. Check out a new branch 
(base) brenda@Brendas-MacBook-Air-2 github % cd GitHub-Collaboration-Practice
(base) brenda@Brendas-MacBook-Air-2 GitHub-Collaboration-Practice % gitHub % git checkout -b new_branch

4c. The member who initialized the repository should add this text: “Degree Programs & Research Interests of Members”. They should then add, commit, and push changes to the repo. Important: This
step should ONLY be done by the member who initialized the repository.

(base) brenda@Brendas-MacBook-Air-2 GitHub-Collaboration-Practice % nano "File 1.txt"
(base) brenda@Brendas-MacBook-Air-2 GitHub-Collaboration-Practice % cat "File 1.txt"
Group Project
"Degree Programs & Research Interest of Members"
(base) brenda@Brendas-MacBook-Air-2 GitHub-Collaboration-Practice % git add "File 1.txt"
(base) brenda@Brendas-MacBook-Air-2 GitHub-Collaboration-Practice % git commit -m "added text for people to complete their program interests"

4.d. Merge main with new_branch -- I did the branch after I created these changed in main, so when I run the command git merge main it says it's already up to date
GitHub-Collaboration-Practice git:(new_branch_brenda) git merge main
Already up to date.

4.e Edit the text file to add your degree program and some keywords
for your research interests.

➜  GitHub-Collaboration-Practice git:(new_branch_brenda) nano "File 1.txt"
➜  GitHub-Collaboration-Practice git:(new_branch_brenda) ✗ git status
